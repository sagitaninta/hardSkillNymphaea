This file explains all of the variables in each dataset that accompanies: Adams, B.T., S.N. Matthews. Diverse temperate forest bird assemblages demonstrate closer correspondence to plant species composition than vegetation structure. Ecography.

dataset: bta_snm_vbirds.csv
Bird species abundances named with avian alpha codes.

dataset: bta_snm_vlidar.csv
This dataset includes the LiDAR derived vegetation structural variables.
chm_max	=	Maximum vegetation height return in m.
chm_mea	=	Mean vegetation height return in m.
chm_std	=	Standard deviation vegetation height return in m.
pen2_50	=	Return penetration ratio 2/50.
pen2_10	=	Return penetration ratio 2/10.
pen1_5	=	Return penetration ratio 1/5.
vegEven	=	Foliage Height Diversity (MacArthur, R. H. and MacArthur, J. W. 1961. On bird species diversity. - Ecology 42: 594â€“598).

dataset: bta_snm_vfield.csv
This dataset includes the field derived vegetation structural variables, as well as ecological landtype (ELT).
all_stem_den	=	Total stem density (# of stems per ha) of both under and overstory stems.
big_stem_bas	=	Large stem basal area (m2/ha) of trees [stems/trees >/=8 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)].
can_covr_mea	=	Percent canopy cover.
can_heig_mea	=	Mean canopy height in m.
ELT				=	Ecological landtype (DO = dry-oak; DM = dry-mesic; WM = wet-mesic).

dataset: bta_snm_vlitde.csv
This dataset includes the vegetation composition (stem density - # stems per ha) of the little (i.e., understory) stems <8 cm diameter at breast height (DBH).
Species are given with scientific names.

dataset: bta_snm_vbigde.csv
This dataset includes the vegetation composition (stem density - # stems per ha) of the big (i.e., overstory) stems/trees >/=8 cm diameter at breast height (DBH).
Species are given with scientific names.

dataset: bta_snm_vallde.csv
This dataset includes the vegetation composition (stem density - # stems per ha) of combined little and big stems.
Species are given with scientific names.
